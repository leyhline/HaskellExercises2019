# Haskell Exercises 2019

These are solutions the the Functional Programming course from the University of Freiburg, summer 2019.

The corresponding repository from the Chair of Programming Languages is: https://github.com/proglang/FunctionalProgramming/

All the important code is in the `src` folder with modules for each exercise sheet and submodules for each exercise.

## Development Environment

This is not mandatory, but I am using Visual Studio Code because of the really nice [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) it supports. The backend is the [Haskell IDE Engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine).

And of course I am using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) because this seems to be the standard nowadays.
